# QRfactorization
What is QR Factorization?
QR factorization is a method in linear algebra where a given matrix 𝐴 is decomposed into the product of two matrices:
1 - Q: An orthogonal (or unitary) matrix where columns are orthonormal vectors ( Q.Q^T = I)
2- R: An upper triangular matrix.
Mathematically, 
𝐴 = 𝑄𝑅
A=QR. It is primarily used in solving linear systems, least squares problems, and numerical algorithms for eigenvalues.
